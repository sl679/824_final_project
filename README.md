# 824_final_project

Project discription

	The project uses Breast Cancer Wisconsin (diagnosis) dataset extracted from Kaggle website, provided by UCI Machine Learning. This project aims to
	classify benign tumors from the malignant ones using various machine learning methods. First, we will generate some plots to better understand the
	variables in this data set. Then, we will divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set by a pre-specified ratio. After training with 
	the training set, we will test the accuracy of the model using the testing set for each machine learning method. We will compare the models and 
	make a decision of the best model for this data set.
